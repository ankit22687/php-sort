# PHP-Sort

- Getting a comma-separated list of email addresses from json
- Sort a JSON in age descending order and add extra key 'name' to each element.

### php-sort.php

- User Predefined PHP library function to sort

### quick-sort.php

- Use Quick sort algorithm to sort array
- Quicksort will have a best-case running time when the pivot at each recursive call is equal to the median element of the subarray. Each call takes O ( n ) O(n) O(n) time (from the division step), so the total run time of the best-case quicksort is O ( n log ‚Å° n ) O(n log n) O(nlogn)
- Quicksort partitions an array and then calls itself recursively twice to sort the two resulting subarrays. This algorithm is quite efficient for large-sized data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are O(n2), respectively.
